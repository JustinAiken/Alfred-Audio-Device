Introduction
===

This is an [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow for
changing the OS X input and output audio devices. Under the hood it uses
[SwitchAudio](https://github.com/deweller/switchaudio-osx) from deweller on
GitHub.

For more information and pretty pictures, I made a blog post about this when
I initially wrote it. http://michael.thegrebs.com/2013/01/18/alfred2-audio-device/
